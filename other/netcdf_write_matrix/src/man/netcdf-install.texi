@cindex binary install
@cindex installing binary distribution

At NetCDF World Headquarters hundreds of programmers labor around the
clock to make netCDF easier to get and use.

Perhaps the easiest way to get netCDF is to get a pre-built binary
distribution. To get them, see @uref{@value{netcdf-binaries-url}}.

To install the binary distribution, uncompress and unpack the tar
file. You will end up with 4 subdirectories, lib, include, man, and
bin. 

The lib subdirectory holds the netCDF library. The include directory
holds the necessary netcdf.h file. The bin directory holds the ncgen
and ncdump utilities, and the man directory holds the netCDF
documentation.

You can have these directories anywhere you like, and use netCDF. But
when compiling a netCDF program, you will have to tell the linker
where to find the library (e.g. with the -L option of most C
compilers), and you will also have to tell the C pre-processor where
to find the include file (e.g. with the -I option).

@node Quick Instructions for Installing NetCDF on Unix, Building and Installing NetCDF on Unix Systems, installing-binaries, Top
@chapter Quick Instructions for Installing NetCDF on Unix
@cindex quick unix instructions

Who has time to read long installation manuals these days?

To install netCDF, uncompress and unpack the tar file, then change to
the src directory:

@example
gunzip netcdf-3.6.1.tar.gz
tar -xf netcdf-3.6.1.tar
cd netcdf-3.6.1/src
@end example

Now run the usual configure, make check, make install cycle:

@example
./configure
make check
make install
@end example

The configure script will try to find necessary tools in your
path. When you run configure you may optionally use the --prefix
argument to change the default installation directory. For example,
the following will install the library in /usr/local/lib, the header
file in /usr/local/include, and the utilities in /usr/local/bin.

@example
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
@end example

The default install root is .. (i.e. the parent directory, which will
be netcdf-3.6.1). 

If all this doesn't work, then you might have to read the next
chapter. Better luck next time!

@section Installation Requirements
@cindex installation requirements
@cindex large file tests requirements
@cindex extra_test requirements
@cindex extra_check requirements

Depending on the platform, you may need up to 25 Mbytes of free space
to unpack, build, and run the tests. You will also need a Standard C
compiler. If you have compilers for FORTRAN 77, FORTRAN 90, or C++,
the corresponding netCDF language interfaces may also be built and
tested. Compilers and associated tools will only be found if they are
in your path.

If you want to run the large file tests, you will need about 13 GB of
free disk space, as some very large files are created. The created
files are immediately deleted after the tests complete. These large
file tests are not run as part of the make check step; they are only
run for make extra_check.

If you wish to build from source on a Windows (Win32) platform,
different instructions apply. @xref{Building and Installing NetCDF on
Windows}.

To fully work with the netCDF source code, several extra utilities are
required to fully build everything from source. If you are going to
modify the netCDF source code, you will need some or all of the
following Unix tools.

@ftable @code

@item m4
Macro processing language used heavily in libsrc, nc_test. Generates
(in these cases) C code from m4 source. Version 1.4 works fine with
release 3.5.1 through 3.6.1. 

@item nm
Lists contents of an ``object'' file. GNU nm does not mix well with
vendor compilers in the 64-bit world, so make sure that you are using
GNU nm with GNU compilers, or a vendor nm with your vendor
compiler. 

@item ar
Creates libraries. GNU ar does not mix well with vendor compilers in
the 64-bit world, so make sure that you are using GNU ar with GNU
compilers, or a vendor ar with your vendor compiler.

@end ftable

The following tools are not required to build netCDF. They may be
needed if you intend to work with the netCDF source code as a
developer. 

@ftable @code

@item flex and yacc
Used in ncgen directory to parse CDL files. Generates C files from .y
and .l files. You only need to use this to modify ncgen's understanding of
CDL grammar.

@item makeinfo
Generates all documentation formats (except man pages) from texinfo
source. I'm using makeinfo version 4.2, as of release 3.6.0. If you
have trouble with makeinfo, upgrade to at least 4.2 and try again. You
only need makeinfo if you want to modify the documentation.

@item autoconf
Generates the configure script. Autoconf is only needed to modify the
configure script. Version 2.59 or later is required. Automake is not
used with netCDF version 3.6.

@end ftable

The most recent version of all netCDF documents can always be found at
the netCDF website. @uref{@value{netcdf-url}}.

@node Specifying the Environment for Building, Building on 64 Bit Platforms, Installation Requirements, Building and Installing NetCDF on Unix Systems
@section Specifying the Environment for Building

The netCDF configure script will set some environment variables that
are important for building from source code. It is only necessary to
set them to override default behavior.

The netCDF configure script searches your path to find the compilers
and tools it needed. To use compilers that can't be found in your
path, set their environment variables.

When finding compilers, vendor compilers will be preferred to GNU
compilers. Not because we don't like GNU, but because we assume if you
purchased a compiler, you want to use it. Setting CC allows you to
over-ride this preference. (Alternatively, you could temporarily
remove the compiler's directories from your PATH.)

For example, on an AIX system, configure will first search for xlc,
the AIX compiler. If not found, it will try gcc, the GNU compiler. To
override this behavior, set CC to gcc (in sh: export CC=gcc). (But
don't forget to also set CXX to g++, or else configure will try and
use xlC, the AIX C++ compiler.)

By default, the netCDF library is built with assertions turned on. If
you wish to turn off assertions, set CPPFLAGS to -DNDEBUG (csh ex:
setenv CPPFLAGS -DNDEBUG).

Variable Description Notes

@item CC 
@tab C compiler 
@tab If you don't specify this, the configure script will try to
find a suitable C compiler such as cc, c89, xlc, or gcc. 

@item FC 
@tab Fortran compiler (if any) 
@tab If you don't specify this, the configure script will try to find a
suitable Fortran 90 or Fortran 77 compiler. Set FC to "" explicitly,
if no Fortran interface is desired.

@item F90 
@tab Fortran 90 compiler (if any) 
@tab If you don't specify this, the configure script will try to find a
suitable Fortran 90 compiler. Not needed if FC specifies a Fortran 90
compiler. Set F90 to "" explicitly, if no Fortran 90 interface
desired. For a vendor F90 compiler, make sure you're using the same
vendor's F77 compiler. Using Fortran compilers from different vendors, or
mixing vendor compilers with g77, the GNU F77 compiler, is not
supported and may not work.

@item CXX 
@tab C++ compiler 
@tab If you don't specify this, the configure script will try to find a

@section Building on 64 Bit Platforms
@cindex 64-bit platforms
@cindex SunOS 64-bit build
@cindex AIX 64-bit build

Some platforms support special options to build in 64-bit mode. 

NetCDF @value{VERSION} has been tested as 64-bit builds on SunOS,
Irix, and AIX. The options needed to build in 64-bit mode on these
platforms are described here, and can be turned on by providing the
--enable-64bit flag to configure.

@table @code

@item AIX
Set -q64 option in all compilers, and set NMFLAGS to -X64, and ARFLAGS
to '-X64 cru'. Alternatively, set environment variable OBJECT_MODE to
64 before running configure.

@item IRIX 
Set the -64 option in all compilers.

@item SunOS
Use the -xarch=v9 flag on all compilers. This is not supported on the
x86 platform.

@section Running the configure Script
@cindex configure, running
@cindex running configure
@cindex install directory
@cindex prefix argument of configure
@cindex config.log

To create the Makefiles needed to build netCDF, you must run the
provided configure script. Go to the top-level netCDF src/ directory.

Decide where you want to install this package. Use this for the
"--prefix=" argument to the configure script below. The default
installation prefix is "..", which will install the package's files in
../bin, ../lib, and ../man relative to the netCDF src/ directory.

Execute the configure script:

@example
    ./configure --prefix=whatever_you_decided
@end example

The "--prefix=..." specification is optional; if omitted, ".."
designating the parent directory will be used as a default. There are
other options for the configure script. The most useful ones are
listed below. Use the --help option to get the full list.

@table @code

@item --prefix
Specify the directory under which netCDF will be
installed. Directories lib and bin will be created, as well as some
others. The default value for prefix is one directory up from the src
directory, where the build takes place.

@item --disable-flag-setting
By default the configure script changes some compiler flags to allow
netCDF to build on your platform. If you wish to specify compiler
flags which conflict with the ones added by the configure script, then
use this option to instruct configure not to attempt to set any
compiler flags. It is then the responsibility of the user to correctly
set CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, etc. (Note that this flag does not affect some
setting of flags by configure for GNU platforms; it just turns off any
special netCDF flags.

@item --enable-64bit
Compile for 64-bit platform on Sun, AIX, HPUX, or Irix. (Has no effect
on other platforms). Since this works by setting some compiler flags,
this option is incompatible with --disable-flag-setting.

@end table

The configure script will examine your computer system -- checking for
attributes that are relevant to building the netCDF package. It will
print to standard output the checks that it makes and the results that
it finds.

The configure script will also create the file "config.log", which
will contain error messages from the utilities that the configure
script uses in examining the attributes of your system. Because such
an examination can result in errors, it is expected that "config.log"
will contain error messages. Therefore, such messages do not
necessarily indicate a problem (a better indicator would be failure of
the subsequent "make"). One exception, however, is an error message in
"config.log" that indicates that a compiler could not be started. This
indicates a severe problem in your compilation environment -- one that
you must fix.

@node Running make, Testing the Build, Running the configure Script, Building and Installing NetCDF on Unix Systems
@section Running make
@cindex make, running
@cindex running make

Run "make". This will build one or more netCDF libraries. It will
build the basic netCDF library libsrc/libnetcdf.a. If you have Fortran
77 or Fortran 90 compilers, then the Fortran interfaces will be
included in this library. If you have a C++ compiler, then the C++
interface will be built into the library cxx/libnetcdf_c++.a. This
will also build the netCDF utilities ncgen(1) and ncdump(1).

Run make like this:
@example
make
@end example

@node Testing the Build, Installing NetCDF, Running make, Building and Installing NetCDF on Unix Systems
@section Testing the Build
@cindex tests, running
@cindex make test
@cindex make check
@cindex make extra_test
@cindex make extra_check
@cindex large file tests
@cindex testing large file features
@cindex TEMP_LARGE
@cindex make slow_check
@cindex make lfs_test
@cindex make all_large_tests

Run ``make check'' to verify that the netCDF library and executables
have been built properly (you can instead run ``make test'' which does
the same thing). 

A make check will build and run various test programs that test the C,
Fortran, and C++ interfaces as well as the "ncdump" and "ncgen"
utility programs. 

Lines in the output beginning with "***" report on success or failure
of the tests; any failures will be reported before halting the
test. Compiler and linker warnings during the testing may be ignored.

Run the tests like this:

@example
make check
@end example

If you plan to use the 64-bit offset format (introduced in version
3.6.0) to create very large files (i.e. larger than 2 GB), you should
probably run ``make extra_check which tests the large file
features. You must have 13 GB of free disk space for these tests to
successfully run.

If you are running make extra_check, you may wish to override the make
file variable TEMP_LARGE to specify a directory to which large files
can be written. The default is to create them in the nc_test
subdirectory of the netCDF build.

Run the large file tests like this:

@example
make extra_check
@end example

Or, to specify a directory where the large files should be written
during the tests (the example below uses the /tmp directory):

@example
make TEMP_LARGE=/tmp extra_check
@end example

If you have an environment variable TEMP_LARGE, the configure script
will tell the makefile to use that directory for large files. 

All of the large files are removed on successful completion of
tests. If the test fails, you may wish to make sure that no large
files have been left around.

If any of the the large file tests test fail, run make check to run
additional large file tests, including a test which uses the dd
command to ensure that your file system can handle files larger than 2
GiB. This test runs the command:

@example
	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=3000 of=$(TEMP_LARGE)/largefile
@end example

If your system does not have a /dev/zero, this test will fail. If all
other tests pass, this is if no concern, but if other tests fail, you
need to somehow ensure that your file system can handle very large
files. 

These tests are slower; to run the slow large file tests:

@example
make slow_check
@end example

This file system test can also be run by going into the directory
nc_test and making the target lfs_test. The target slow_check runs an
additional large file test, which writes about 4GiB of data to a file,
and then rereads it. Also in the nc_test directory, the target
all_large_tests will run all the large file tests.

The following platform-specific note may be helpful when building and
installing netCDF. Consult your vendor manuals for information about
the options listed here. Compilers can change from version to version;
the following information may not apply to your platform.

Full output from some of the platforms of the test platforms for
netCDF @value{VERSION} can be found at @uref{@value{netcdf-builds}}.

@subsection AIX

We found the vendor compilers in /usr/vac/bin, and included this 
in our PATH. Compilers were xlc, xlf, xlf90, xlC.

The F90 compiler requires the qsuffix option to believe that F90 code
files can end with .f90. This is automatically turned on by configure
when needed (we hope):
@example
    F90FLAGS=-qsuffix=f=f90
@end example

We had to use xlf for F77 code, and xlf90 for F90 code.

To compile 64-bit code, use the --enable-64bit option when running
configure, and it will set the appropriate environment variables for
you (documented below).

The environment variable OBJECT_MODE can be set to 64, or use the -q64
option on all AIX compilers by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to
-q64.

The following is also necessary on an IBM AIX SP system for 64-bit
mode:

@example
    ARFLAGS='-X64 cru'
    NMFLAGS='-X64'
@end example

There are thread-safe versions of the AIX compilers. For example,
xlc_r is the thread-safe C compiler. The NetCDF configure script
ignores these compilers. To use thread-safe compilers, override the
configure script by setting CC to xlc_r; similarly for FC and CXX.

For large file support, AIX requires that the macro _LARGE_FILES be
defined. The configure script does this using
AC_SYS_LARGEFILES. Unfortunately, this misfires when OBJECT_MODE is
64, or the q64 option is used. The netCDF tries to fix this by turning
on _LARGE_FILES anyway in these cases.

The GNU C compiler does not mix successfully with the AIX fortran
compilers. 

@subsection Cygwin

NetCDF builds under Cygwin tools on Windows just as with Linux.

@subsection HPUX

The HP Fortran compiler (f77, a.k.a. fort77, also f90) requires FLIBS
to include -lU77 for the fortran tests to work. The configure script
does this automatically.

For the c89 compiler to work, CPPFLAGS must include
-D_HPUX_SOURCE. This isn't required for the cc compiler. The configure
script adds this as necessary.

For large file support, HP-UX requires _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64. The
configure script sets this automatically.

The HPUX C++ compiler doesn't work on netCDF code. It's too old for
that. So either use GNU to compile netCDF, or skip the C++ code by
setting CXX to '' (in csh: setenv CXX '').

Building a 64 bit version may be possible with the following settings:
@example
    CC=/bin/cc
    CPPFLAGS='-D_HPUX_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'    # large file support
    CFLAGS='-g +DD64'                           # 64-bit mode
    FC=/opt/fortran90/bin/f90                   # Fortran-90 compiler
    FFLAGS='-w +noppu +DA2.0W'                  # 64-bit mode, no "_" suffixes
    FLIBS=-lU77
    CXX=''                                      # no 64-bit mode C++ compiler
@end example

Sometimes quotas or configuration causes HPUX disks to be limited to 2
GiB files. In this cases, netCDF cannot create very large
files. Rather confusingly, HPUX returns a system error that indicates
that a value is too large to be stored in a type. This may cause
scientists to earnestly check for attempts to write floats or doubles
that are too large. In fact, the problem seems to be an internal
integer problem, when the netCDF library attempts to read beyond the 2
GiB boundary. To add to the confusion, the boundary for netCDF is
slightly less than 2 GiB, since netCDF uses buffered I/O to improve
performance.

@subsection Irix

A 64-bit version can be built with the --enable-64bit option when
running configure; it will set the appropriate environment variables
for you.

It builds 64-bit by setting CFLAGS, FFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS to -64.

On our machine, there is a /bin/cc and a /usr/bin/cc, and the -64
option only works with the former.

@subsection Linux

The f2cFortran flag is required with GNU fortran:
@example
    CPPFLAGS=-Df2cFortran
@end example

For Portland Group Fortran, set pgiFortran instead:
@example
    CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran
@end example

Portland Group F90/F95 does not mix with GNU g77.

The netCDF configure script should notice which fortran compiler is
being used, and set these automatically.

For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be set to 64. The
netCDF configure script should set this automatically.

@subsection Macintosh

The f2cFortran flag is required with GNU fortran
(CPPFLAGS=-Df2cFortran). The NetCDF configure script should and set
this automatically.

For IBM compilers on the Mac, the following may work (we lack this
test environment):
@example
    CC=/usr/bin/cc
    CPPFLAGS=-DIBMR2Fortran
    FC=xlf
    F90=xlf90
    F90FLAGS=-qsuffix=cpp=f90
@end example

@subsection OSF1

NetCDF builds out of the box on OSF1.

@subsection SunOS

PATH should contain /usr/ccs/bin to find make, nm, ar, etc.

For large file support, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS must be 64. Configure will
turn this on automatically.

Large file support doesn't work with c89, unless the -Xa option is
used. The netCDF configure script turns this on automatically where
appropriate.

To compile in 64-bit mode, use option --enable-64bit with
configure. It sets -xarch=v9 on all compilers (i.e. in CFLAGS, FFLAGS,
and CXXFLAGS).

When compiling with GNU Fortran (g77), the -Df2cFortran flag is
required for the Fortran interface to work. The NetCDF configure
script turns this on automatically if needed.

@subsection Handling Fortran Compilers

Commercial fortran compilers will generally require at least one flag
in the CPPFLAGS veriable. The netCDF configure script tries to set
this for you, but won't try if you have used --disable-flag-setting,
or if you have already set CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FCFLAGS, or
F90FLAGS yourself.

The first thing to try is to set nothing and see if the netCDF
configure script finds your fortran compiler, and sets the correct
flags automatically.

If it doesn't find the correct fortran compiler, you can next try
setting the FC environment variable to the compiler you wish to use,
and then see if the configure script can set the correct flags for
that compiler.

If all that fails, you must set the flags yourself.

The intel compiler likes the pgiFortran flag, as does the Portland
Group compiler. (Automatically turned on if your fortran compiler is
named ``ifort'' or ``pgf90'').

The configure and build system should work on any system which has a
modern "sh" shell, "make", and so on. The configure and build system
is less portable than the "C" code itself, however. You may run into
problems with the "include" syntax in the Makefiles. You can use GNU
make to overcome this, or simply manually include the specified files
after running configure.

Instruction for building netCDF on other platforms can be found at
@uref{@value{netcdf-other-builds}}. If you build netCDF on a new
platform, please send your environment variables and any other
important notes to @value{netcdf-support-email} and we will add the
information to the other builds page, with a credit to you.

If you can't run the configure script, you will need to create
libsrc/ncconfig.h and fortran/nfconfig.inc. Start with
libsrc/ncconfig.in and fortran/nfconfig.in and set the defines as
appropriate for your system.

Operating system dependency is isolated in the "ncio" module. We
provide two versions. posixio.c uses POSIX system calls like "open()",
"read()" and "write().  ffio.c uses a special library available on
CRAY systems. You could create other versions for different operating
systems. The program "t_ncio.c" can be used as a simple test of this
layer.

Note that we have not had a Cray to test on for some time. In
particular, large file support is not tested with ffio.c.

Numerical representation dependency is isolated in the "ncx"
module. As supplied, ncx.m4 (ncx.c) supports IEEE floating point
representation, VAX floating point, and CRAY floating
point. BIG_ENDIAN vs LITTLE_ENDIAN is handled, as well as various
sizes of "int", "short", and "long". We assume, however, that a "char"
is eight bits.

There is a separate implementation of the ncx interface available as
ncx_cray.c which contains optimizations for CRAY vector
architectures. Move the generic ncx.c out of the way and rename
ncx_cray.c to ncx.c to use this module. By default, this module does
not use the IEG2CRAY and CRAY2IEG library calls. When compiled with
aggressive in-lining and optimization, it provides equivalent
functionality with comparable speed and clearer error semantics. If
you wish to use the IEG library functions, compile this module with
-DUSE_IEG.

NetCDF can be built and used from a variety of development
environments on Windows. The netCDF library is implemented as a
Windows dynamic link library (DLL). The simplest way to get started
with netCDF under Windows is to download the pre-built DLL from the
Unidata web site.

Building under the Cygwin port of GNU tools is treated as a Unix
install. @xref{Platform Specific Notes}.

Instructions are also given for building the netCDF DLL from the
source code.

VC++ documentation being so voluminous, finding the right information
can be a chore. There's a good discussion of using DLLs called ``About
Dynamic-Link Libraries'' at (perhaps)
@uref{http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_libraries.asp}.

From the .NET point of view, the netCDF dll is unmanaged code. As a
starting point, see the help topic ``Consuming Unmanaged DLL
Functions'' which may be found at
@uref{http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconConsumingUnmanagedDLLFunctions.asp},

Whether you get the pre-built DLL or build your own, you'll then have
to install it somewhere so that your other programs can find it and
use it.

To install a DLL, you just have to leave it in some directory, and
(possibly) tell your compiler what directory to look for it in.

A DLL is a library, and functions just like libraries under the Unix
operating system. As with any library, the point of the netCDF DLL is
to provide functions that you can call from your own code. When you
compile that code, the linker needs to be able to find the library,
and then it pulls out the functions that it needs. In the Unix world,
the -L option tells the compiler where to look for a library. In
Windows, library search directories can be added to the project's
property dialog.

Similarly, you will need to put the header file, netcdf.h, somewhere
that you compiler can find it. In the Unix world, the -I option tells
the compiler to look in a certain directory to find header files. In
the Windows world, you set this in the project properties dialog box
of your integrated development environment.

Therefore, installing the library means nothing more than copying the
DLL somewhere that your compiler can find it, and telling the compiler
where to look for them.

The standard place to put DLLs is Windows\System32 folder (for
Windows2000/XP) or the Windows\System folder (for Windows 98/ME). If
you put the DLL there, along with the ncgen and ncdump executables,
you will be able to use the DLL and utilities without further work,
because compilers already look there for DLLs and EXEs.

Instead of putting the DLL and EXEs into the system directory, you can
leave them wherever you want, and every development project that uses
the dll will have to be told to search the netCDF directory when it's
linking, or, the chosen directory can be added to your path.

On the .NET platform, you can also try to use the global assembly
cache. (To learn how, see MSDN topic ``Global Assembly Cache'', at
@uref{www.msdn.microsoft.com}).

Following Windows conventions, the netCDF files belong in the

@section Building netcdf.dll with VC++ 6.0
@cindex VC++ 6.0, building with

The most recent releases of netCDF aren't tested under VC++ 6.0. (They
are tested with VC++.NET). Older versions of the library, notably
3.5.0, did compile with VC++ 6.0, and the instructions for doing so
are presented below.

Note that the introduction of better large file support (for files
larger than 2 GiB) in version 3.6.0 and greater requires an off_t type
of 8 bytes, and it's not clear how, or if, this can be found in VC++
6.0.

To build the library yourself, get the file 
@value{windows-ftp-site}netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip

The makefiles there describe how to build netcdf-3.5
using the using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.x and (optionally)
Digital Visual Fortran 6.x. Because of difficulties in getting
Microsoft Visual Studio to fall in line with our existing
source directory scheme, we chose _not_ to build the system
"inside" Visual Studio. Instead, we provide a simple group
of "msoft.mak" files which can be used. If you
wish to work in Visual Studio, go ahead. Read the
section called "Macros" at the end of this discussion.

As of this writing, we have not tried compiling the
C++ interface in this environment.

nmake is a Microsoft version of make, which comes with VC 6.0 (and VC
7.0) in directory C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin
(or, for VC 7.0, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
2003\Vc7\bin).

To build netcdf, proceed as follows:

@table @code

@item unpack source distribution.

@item copy netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip 
copy netcdf-3.5.0.win32make.VC6.zip into the netcdf-3.5.0/src
directory, and unzip it from there.

@item cd src\libsrc; nmake /f msoft.mak
Run this command in src\libsrc. This will build netcdf.lib and
netcdf.dll Note: This makefiles make DLLs. To make static libraries
see section on static libraries.

@item nmake /f msoft.mak test
Optionally, in src\libsrc, make and run the simple test.

@item cd ..\fortran; nmake /f msoft.mak
Optionally build the fortran interface and rebuild dll in ..\libsrc to
include the fortran interface. Note Bene: We don't provide a .DEF
file, so this step changes the "ordinals" by which entry points in the
DLL found. Some sites may wish to modify the msoft.mak file(s) to
produce a separate library for the fortran interface.

@item nmake /f msoft.mak test
(necessary if you want to use fortran code) While you are in
src\fortran; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests the netcdf-2 fortran
interface.

@item cd ..\nctest; nmake /f msoft.mak test
(optional, but recommended) In src\nctest; nmake /f msoft.mak test
This tests the netcdf-2 C interface.

@item cd ..\nc_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test
(optional, but highly recommended) In src\nc_test; nmake /f msoft.mak
test This tortures the netcdf-3 C interface.

@item cd ..\nf_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test
(optional, but highly recommended if you built the fortran interface)
In src\nf_test; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tortures the netcdf-3
fortran interface.

@item ..\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak
In src\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak This makes ncdump.exe.

@item ..\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak
In src\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak This makes ncgen.exe.

@item ..\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak test
(optional) In src\ncdump; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests
ncdump. Both ncgen and ncdump need to be built prior to this
test. Note the makefile sets the path so that ..\libsrc\netcdf.dll can
be located.

@item ..\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak test
(optional) In src\ncgen; nmake /f msoft.mak test This tests
ncgen. Both ncgen and ncdump need to be built prior to this test. Note
the makefile sets the path so that ..\libsrc\netcdf.dll can be
located.

@item To Install
Copy libsrc\netcdf.lib to a LIBRARY directory.
Copy libsrc\netcdf.h and fortran/netcdf.inc to an INCLUDE directory.
Copy libsrc\netcdf.dll, ncdump/ncdump.exe, and ncgen/ncgen.exe to

file with Visual Studio. Both Debug and Release configurations are
available - select one and build.

The resulting netcdf.dll file will be in subdirectory Release or

The netCDF tests will be built and run as part of the build
process. The Fortran 77 interface will be built, but not the Fortran
90 or C++ interfaces.

The quick_large_files test program is provided as an extra project,
however it is not run during the build process, but can be run from
the command line or the IDE. Note that, despite its name, it is not
quick. On Unix systems, this program runs in a few seconds, because of
some features of the Unix file system apparently not present in
Windows. Nonetheless, the program does run, and creates (then deletes)
some very large files. (So make sure you have at least 15 GiB of space
available). It takes about 45 minutes to run this program on our

@cindex visual studio 2003 properties

Load-time linking to the DLL is the most straightforward from
C++. This means the netcdf.lib file has to end up on the compile
command line. This being Windows, that's hidden by a GUI.

In Visual Studio 2003 this can be done by modifying three of the
project's properties. 

Open the project properties window from the project menu. Go to the
linker folder and look at the general properties. Modify the property
``Additional Library Directories'' by adding the directory which
contains the netcdf.dll and netcdf.lib files.  Now go to the linker
input properties and set the property ``Additional Dependencies'' to
netcdf.lib.

Finally, still within the project properties window, go to the C/C++
folder, and look at the general properties. Modify ``Additional
Include Directories'' to add the directory with the netcdf.h file.

Now use the netCDF functions in your C++ code. Of course any C or C++
file that wants to use the functions will need:

@example
#include <netcdf.h>

@section The Usual Build Problems

@subsection Taking the Easy Way Out

Why not take the easy way out if you can? 

Precompiled binaries for many platforms can be found at
@url{@value{netcdf-binaries-url}}. Click on your platform, and copy
the files from the bin, include, lib, and man directories into your
own local equivalents (Perhaps /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include,
etc.).

@subsection How to Clean Up the Mess from a Failed Build

If you are trying to get the configure or build to work, make sure you
start with a clean distribution for each attempt. If netCDF failed in
the ``make'' you must clean up the mess before trying again. To clean
up the distribution:

@example
make distclean
@end example

@subsection Platforms On Which NetCDF is Known to Work

At NetCDF World Headquarters (in sunny Boulder, Colorado), as part of
the wonderful Unidata organization, we have a wide variety of
computers, operating systems, and compilers. At night, house elves
test netCDF on all these systems. 

Output for the netCDF test platforms can be found at
@url{@value{netcdf-builds}}.

Compare the output of your build attempt with ours. Are you using the
same compiler? The same flags? Look for the configure output that
lists the settings of CC, FC, CXX, CFLAGS, etc. 

On some systems you have to set environment variables to get the
configure and build to work. 

For example, for a 64-bit IRIX install of the netCDF-3.6.1 release,
the variables are set before netCDF is configured or built. In this
case we set CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and FFLAGS. (This can also be
accomplished automatically by using --enable-64bit with configure.)

@example
flip% uname -a
IRIX64 flip 6.5 07080050 IP30 mips
flip% setenv CFLAGS -64
flip% setenv CXXFLAGS -64
flip% setenv FFLAGS -64
flip% make distclean;./configure;make extra_check
@end example

@subsection Platforms On Which NetCDF is Reported to Work

If your platform isn't listed on the successful build page, see if
another friendly netCDF user has sent in values for environment
variables that are reported to work:
(@uref{@value{netcdf-other-builds}}).

If you build on a system that we don't have at Unidata (particularly
if it's something interesting and exotic), please send us the settings
that work (and the entire build output would be nice too). Send them
to @value{netcdf-support-email}.

@subsection If You Have a Broken Compiler

For netCDF to build correctly, you must be able to compile C from your
environment, and, optionally, Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C++. If
C doesn't work, netCDF can't compile. 

What breaks a C compiler? Installation or upgrade mistakes when the C
compiler was installed, or multiple versions or compilers installed on
top of each other. Commercial compilers frequently require some
environment variables to be set, and some directories to appear ahead
of others in your path. Finally, if you have an expired or broken
license, your C complier won't work.

If you have a broken C compiler and a working C compiler in your PATH,
netCDF might only find the broken one. You can fix this by explicitly
setting the CC environmental variable to a working C compiler, and
then trying to build netCDF again. (Don't forget to do a ``make
distclean'' first!)

If you can't build a C program, you can't build netCDF. Sorry, but
that's just the way it goes. (You can get the GNU C compiler - search
the web for ``gcc'').

If netCDF finds a broken Fortran 90, Fortran 77, or C++ compiler, it
will report the problem during the configure, and then drop the
associated API. For example, if the C++ compiler can't compile a very
simple test program, it will drop the C++ interface. If you really
want the C++ API, set the CXX environment variable to a working C++
compiler.

@subsection What to Do If NetCDF Still Won't Build

@cindex turning off C++, Fortran interface

@subsection Problems During Configuration

If the ./configure; make check fails, it's a good idea to turn off the
C++ and Fortran interfaces, and try to build the C interface
alone. All other interfaces depend on the C interface, so nothing else
will work until the C interface works. To turn off C++ and Fortran,
set environment variables CXX and FC to NULL before running the netCDF
configure script (with csh: setenv FC '';setenv CXX '').

Turning off the Fortran and C++ interfaces results in a much shorter
build and test cycle, which is useful for debugging problems.

If the netCDF configure fails, most likely the problem is with your
development environment. The configure script looks through your path to
find all the tools it needs to build netCDF, including C compiler and
linker, the ar, ranlib, and others. The configure script will tell
you what tools it found, and where they are on your system. Here's
part of configure's output on a Linux machine:

@example
checking CPPFLAGS...  -Df2cFortran
checking CC CFLAGS... cc -g
checking which cc... /usr/bin/cc
checking CXX... c++
checking CXXFLAGS... -g -O2
checking which c++... /usr/local/bin/c++
checking FC... f77
checking FFLAGS... 
checking which f77... /usr/bin/f77
checking F90... unset
checking AR... ar
checking ARFLAGS... cru
checking which ar... /usr/bin/ar
checking NM... nm
checking NMFLAGS... 
checking which nm... /usr/bin/nm
@end example

Make sure that the tools, directories, and flags are set to reasonable
values, and compatible tools. For example the GNU tools may not
inter-operate well with vendor tools. If you're using a vendor
compiler, use the ar, nm, and ranlib that the vendor supplied.

As configure runs, it creates a config.log file. If configure crashes,
do a text search of config.log for thing it was checking before
crashing. If you have a licensing or tool compatibility problem, it
will be obvious in config.log.

@subsection Problems During Compilation

If the configure script runs, but the compile step doesn't work, or
the tests don't complete successfully, the problem is probably in your
CFLAGS or CPPFLAGS. 

@subsection Problems During Testing

If you are planning on using large files (i.e. > 2 GiB), then make
sure you run ``make extra_check to ensure that large files work on
your system. Run this in addition to ``make check.

If any of the tests in ``make extra_check fail, before reporting a
problem, run ``make slow_check'' to run additional large file tests,
including one that will check your file system for large files.
